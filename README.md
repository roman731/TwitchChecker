# TwitchChecker
Simple program I created using JavaFX to check if a specific Twitch.tv streamer is currently online. The program will ping the Twitch API every minute and update the program GUI with the streamer's status(i.e online or offline).

Created using 'IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 15.0.2'.

JDK 1.8 is required.

# GettingStarted
Simply run the .jar file that is included.
